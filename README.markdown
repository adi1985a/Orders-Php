## üìÑ Overview

The **PHP Order Summary Display** page, developed by Adrian Lesniak, is a server-side PHP script designed to present a summary of a customer's order, typically for donuts and combs. It receives order quantities (`paczkow` for donuts, `grzebieni` for combs) and a `haslo` (password, though its use is not detailed) via an HTTP POST request, presumably from a preceding order form (`index.php`). The script then calculates the total cost based on fixed unit prices (0.99 PLN for donuts, 1.29 PLN for combs) and displays these details in a simple HTML table. It also includes an image of a donut (`paczek.jpg`) and a link to return to the main page. All user-facing text is in Polish.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üßæ **Order Summary Table**:
    *   Displays the quantity of donuts (`Liczba pƒÖczk√≥w`).
    *   Displays the quantity of combs (`Liczba grzebieni`).
    *   Shows their respective unit prices.
    *   Presents the calculated total cost (`SUMA ZAM√ìWIENIA`).
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **POST Data Processing**:
    *   Retrieves order quantities for `paczkow` (donuts) and `grzebieni` (combs) from the `$_POST` superglobal.
    *   Also retrieves a `haslo` (password) field, though its purpose or validation is not specified in the current functionality.
*   üí∞ **Total Cost Calculation**:
    *   Computes the total order cost using the formula: `(0.99 * number_of_donuts) + (1.29 * number_of_combs)`.
*   ‚Ü©Ô∏è **Navigation Link**:
    *   Provides a hyperlink "Powr√≥t do strony g≈Ç√≥wnej" (Return to the main page) that directs the user back to `index.php`.
*   üç© **Visual Element**:
    *   Includes an image of a donut (`paczek.jpg`) displayed below the order summary table.
*   üèõÔ∏è **Minimalist HTML Styling**:
    *   Uses basic HTML for structure, with a simple table styled with `border` and `cellpadding` attributes. No external CSS is applied.
*   üáµüá± **Polish Language Interface**:
    *   All user-facing text, including table headers and links, is in Polish (e.g., "Podsumowanie zam√≥wienia", "Liczba pƒÖczk√≥w"). The HTML document is marked with `lang="pl"`.

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots (Conceptual)

**Coming soon!**

_This section would ideally show a screenshot of the order summary page as it appears in a browser after a form submission, displaying the table with order details, the donut image, and the return link._

## üõ†Ô∏è System & Backend Requirements

### For this PHP Summary Page:
*   **Web Server with PHP**: A web server capable of executing PHP scripts (e.g., Apache with `mod_php`, Nginx with PHP-FPM, or PHP's built-in development server).
*   **Web Browser**: To view the HTML output generated by the PHP script.

### Supporting Files & Setup:
*   **`index.php` (or an equivalent order form)**: A preceding HTML or PHP page that contains a form. This form must:
    *   Submit data using the `POST` method.
    *   Have its `action` attribute pointing to this order summary PHP script (e.g., `order_summary.php`).
    *   Include input fields named `paczkow`, `grzebieni`, and `haslo`.
*   **`paczek.jpg` Image**: An image file named `paczek.jpg` must be accessible to the script. The description implies it's located within a specific hardcoded path `/php zelent/zelent 1/`.
*   **Directory Structure**: The script and assets are expected to reside within a specific directory structure on the server (e.g., `/php zelent/zelent 1/`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup & Viewing

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository/Files**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` if applicable, or simply download/create the PHP script and `paczek.jpg` in a local folder structure that mimics `/php zelent/zelent 1/` relative to your web server's document root or the directory you serve with `php -S`.)*

2.  **Ensure Asset and Supporting File Placement**:
    *   Place the PHP script (e.g., `order_summary.php`) in the designated server path (e.g., within `/php zelent/zelent 1/` if using a full server path structure).
    *   Place `paczek.jpg` in the same directory or ensure the `<img>` tag's `src` attribute correctly points to it.
    *   Ensure `index.php` (the page that submits to this script) is also set up and accessible.

3.  **Host on a PHP-Enabled Web Server**:
    *   Configure your web server (like Apache or Nginx) to serve the directory containing your PHP files.
    *   **Alternatively, for simple local development**:
        Navigate to the root directory of your project (e.g., the one containing the `/php zelent/zelent 1/` structure if you've replicated it locally) in your terminal and run PHP's built-in server:
        ```bash
        php -S localhost:8000
        ```
        You would then access the initial order form (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/index.php` or `http://localhost:8000/php_zelent/zelent_1/index.php` depending on how you serve it) to submit data to this summary page.

## üí° Page Usage & Interaction

This PHP script is not typically accessed directly. It's designed to be the **target of an HTML form submission**.

1.  **Navigate to the Order Form (`index.php`)**: Open the webpage that contains the form for ordering donuts and combs in your browser.
2.  **Fill and Submit the Form**:
    *   Enter the desired quantity for `paczkow` (donuts).
    *   Enter the desired quantity for `grzebieni` (combs).
    *   Enter a value for `haslo` (password).
    *   Click the submit button on that form.
3.  **View Order Summary**:
    *   Upon submission, the browser will navigate to this PHP script (e.g., `order_summary.php`).
    *   The script will process the POSTed data and display:
        *   A title like "Podsumowanie zam√≥wienia" (Order Summary).
        *   An HTML table showing the quantities of donuts and combs, their unit prices, and the calculated total cost.
        *   The `paczek.jpg` image below the table.
        *   A link: "Powr√≥t do strony g≈Ç√≥wnej" (Return to the main page), which links back to `index.php`.
4.  **Actions**:
    *   Review the calculated order summary.
    *   Click the "Powr√≥t do strony g≈Ç√≥wnej" link to navigate back to the main order page (`index.php`).

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure (Expected)

For this specific order summary component and its environment:

*   `(order_form_page).php` or `index.php`: (**External but required**) The HTML/PHP page containing the form that POSTs data to the summary script.
*   `order_summary.php` (Suggested name for this script): The PHP file containing the logic to process POST data and display the order summary.
*   `paczek.jpg`: The image file for the donut. Its path is hardcoded in the script as `/php zelent/zelent 1/paczek.jpg` and needs to be accessible by the web server at that location relative to the server's configuration or the script's execution path.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

## üìù Important Notes & Considerations

*   **Polish Language**: The entire user interface generated by this PHP script is in Polish (`lang="pl"`).
*   **`haslo` (Password) Field**: The script captures a `haslo` field from the POST data but does not appear to use or validate it in the provided description. This is a potential security concern or an unused feature. If it's meant for authentication, it requires proper secure handling. If not, it should be removed.
*   **Input Validation**: The description explicitly states **"No validation; ensure valid numeric inputs to avoid errors."** This is a critical vulnerability. The PHP script **must** implement server-side validation to ensure `paczkow` and `grzebieni` are numeric and non-negative before performing calculations to prevent errors, unexpected behavior, or potential security issues (e.g., if these values were used in SQL queries without sanitization).
*   **Hardcoded File Paths**: The path `/php zelent/zelent 1/` for `paczek.jpg` and the link to `index.php` are hardcoded. This makes the script less portable. Using relative paths or configurable paths is generally better practice.
*   **Form Dependency**: This script is entirely dependent on receiving data from a form submission. Accessing it directly without POST data will likely result in errors or an empty summary.
*   **Styling (CSS)**: No custom CSS is applied beyond basic HTML table attributes. The presentation is very minimal.
*   **Security**: Beyond the unused password field, directly using `$_POST` values in calculations without validation can lead to PHP notices/warnings if the keys are not set or if the values are not numeric. Always check `isset()` and validate/sanitize user input.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions to improve this **PHP Order Summary Page** are welcome, especially in areas like:

*   Clarifying or securely implementing the purpose of the `haslo` field.
*   Making file paths configurable or relative.
*   Adding CSS for better visual presentation.
*   Integrating it more clearly with a sample `index.php` order form.
